# Contribution Guidelines

Please create an issue to collect feedback prior to feature additions.  If possible, try to keep PRs scoped to one feature, and add tests for new features.

When showing interest in a bug, enhancement, PR, or issue, please use the thumbs up/thumbs down emoji on the original message rather than adding comments expressing the same.
